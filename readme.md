# Robin Plowman

**R&D Engineer – AI, Scientific, Engineering, Computer Vision & Systems**

I design and build systems that work using mathematics, computer vision, and AI tools to turn complex problems into practical solutions.

I have a BSc in Mathematics from Warwick and an MSc in Computer Vision from York. That foundation in logic, structure, and perception drives how I approach complex systems, from embedded DSPs and C++ pipelines to AI-powered simulations and agent-based architectures.

My background spans embedded systems, multi-threaded large-scale C++, 3D geometry, classical computer vision, data analysis, and increasingly, LLMs and autonomous agents. I’ve worked across R&D and production in domains including ADAS, defence, finance, and education tech.

I find data visualisation central to my workflow, not just for presenting results, but for diagnosing, explaining, and improving large-scale, data-heavy systems.
