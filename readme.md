# Robin Plowman

**R&D Engineer – AI, Vision & Systems**

I design and build systems that work using mathematics, computer vision, and AI tools to turn complex problems into practical solutions.

I have a BSc in Mathematics from Warwick and an MSc in Computer Vision from York. That foundation in logic, structure, and perception drives how I approach complex systems, from embedded DSPs and C++ pipelines to AI-powered simulations and agent-based architectures.

My background spans embedded systems, multi-threaded large-scale C++, 3D geometry, classical computer vision, data analysis, and increasingly, LLMs and autonomous agents. I’ve worked across R&D and production in domains including ADAS, defence, finance, and education tech.

I find data visualisation central to my workflow, not just for presenting results, but for diagnosing, explaining, and improving large-scale, data-heavy systems.

This GitHub is where I prototype and experiment. Much of the code is LLM-assisted, but the architecture, refinement, and insights are mine.

## Philosophy

I try to build tools that are local, open source and owned by the user. 

This matters especially for schools, small businesses, or families who need reliable software without signing up to the expensive subscriptions. It also solves problems with data ownership, like GDPR.

## Projects (Ongoing)
Solving real problems with local AI, modular tools, and a bit of plumbing.

### Local LLM Assistant for a Small Business
Local Phi-3-powered tool that processes Gmail threads, reads calendars and club rosters, drafts admin replies, creates attendance registers, saving hours each week for my partner’s education franchise.
- **Subscription free, GDPR compliant, secure and resistant to prompt injection**
- small prototype to test connection to google suite... [Spelling Extractor project](https://github.com/RobbyPee/spelling-extractor)


### LEGO CV + Game Engine
*top secret for now!* using 3D reconstruction, SFM, reprojection, optimisation. Exploring IP and patentability.

### Cultural Evolution in LLM Societies
A sandbox for simulating multi-agent language drift, memory, and role specialisation, inspired by human cultural evolution after visiting https://en.grottechauvet2ardeche.com/. Built for interpretability and social emergence.

### Meeseeks: Distributed Code Generation
Each class gets its own LLM agent. They write, test, and document themselves, growing a modular software graph over time. Local and scalable by creating layers of abstraction (title is Rick and Morty reference). 
Trying to get LLMs to operate like software engineers

### DIY
I moved and rebuilt our bathroom. Only leaked once whilst plumbing! Still tiling...
